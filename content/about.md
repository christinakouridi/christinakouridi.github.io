Hi there, I'm Christina 👋!

I'm a research engineer based in London, with a particular interest in training machine learning research algorithms at large scale, and applying them to impactufl real-world applications. 

Most recently, I contributed to building [DeepPack](https://www.deeppack.ai/) as a research engineer at [InstaDeep](http://instadeep.com). This involved applying reinforcement learning to BinPacking -- an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem -- in a way that is computationally efficient and generalisable to unseen client data.

Prior to this, I was a research fellow in the Empirical Inference group at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/), where I worked on distributionally robust optimization with Dr. Jia-Jie Zhu and Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf. This was published as "[Adversarially Robust Kernel Smoothing](/research)" (oral presentation at AISTATS 2022).

I completed my MSc in [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning-msc) at University College London,  fully supported by a Cisco AI scholarship. As part of my [MSc thesis](/research), I investigated how the syntactic structure of language can be utilised to improve sample efficiency and generalisation in instruction following, under the guidance of  Dr. Tim Rocktäschel and Minqi Jiang ([UCL DARK](https://t.co/dhC049wxEB) lab).

Before transitioning to AI, I was part of an analytics start-up incubated by fashion e-commerce firm Farfetch. I was involved in all aspects of building a Market Intelligence software and launching Farfetch's first loyalty scheme.

For my first degree, I studied Civil, Energy, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where I received a BA and MEng with Distinction. For my Master's thesis, I performed research on design parameters for automated bridge inspection using Augmented Reality, supervised by Dr. Brilakis in the [Construction Information Technology](https://cit.eng.cam.ac.uk/about-cit) research lab.

My personal interests include classical piano, cycling, and photography -- I particularly enjoy capturing foreign cultures, mountains, and our galaxy.
